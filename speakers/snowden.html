                    <p>Edward Snowden was a contractor who worked at US government agencies. While doing this he learned about NSA surveillance programs and took evidence of them. He thought that it was important that the public learned about this, and leaked the information, and fled the country. He currently has asylum in Russia and will be teleconferencing in for his talk.</p>
